                <p>
                  My final project from the Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp, a Ruby on Rails Web App developed in 2 weeks with the help of 3 other developers: Eleonora Kiziv (Russia), Steve Knight (England) e Sachi Saito (Japan). It's a platform where tourists can rate the English speaking capabilities of the services they use in Brazil (a real problem for foreigners). The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/">Google Places API</a> was used combined with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to find and pinpoint the services.

                  Software written in Ruby to help drop shippers select their products. The user chooses a category on Aliexpress and runs the code, the output will be a CSV file with the all the products's information (name, cost, quantity in stock, shipping options, etc).

                <p>
                  This project was created to learn React JS (understand the components and how they interact with each other without Redux). The user searches for a gif on the search bar, the <a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy API</a>is called and updates the sidebar with a list of gifs based on the userâ€™s input. The user can then click on any gif on the side bar and it will update the main gif displayed at the center of the page.
